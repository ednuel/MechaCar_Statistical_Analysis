# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
# Overall preview of the project
## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
## Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
## Results
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Using lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length+vehicle_weight+spoiler_angle+ground_clearance+AWD,MechaCar) to get the coefficient

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### To find P-value along with r-squared value use summary(lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length+vehicle_weight+spoiler_angle+ground_clearance+AWD,MechaCar) )
## Prediction 
### With the pr(>|t|) value is greater than 0.05, there will be no significant impact on the mpg values and we can reject the null hypothesis. The linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the p value of the multiple linear regression is significantly higher than 0.05 there will be no significant difference

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
### The p value is 1.568e-11 which is greater than 0.05 and is therfore not significant and the null hypothesis can be accepted.

### The p value is 0.0005911 which is less than 0.05 and is therfore significant so the null hypothesis can be rejected.

### The p value is 0.1589 which is greater than 0.05 and is therfore not significant so the null hypothesis can be accepted
